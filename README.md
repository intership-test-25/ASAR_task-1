# 💼 Employee Management System - OOPs in Java

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates the **4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** using a basic Employee Management System.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses an `Employee` interface to define abstract behavior  
- Implements two employee types: `Developer` and `Manager`  
- Inherits shared properties from a `Person` superclass  
- Demonstrates abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

## 🧠 OOPs Concepts Demonstrated

| Pillar            | How it's used                                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstraction**   | `Employee` interface hides implementation details            |
| **Encapsulation** | `Person` class uses private fields and public getters        |
| **Inheritance**   | `Developer` and `Manager` inherit from `Person`              |
| **Polymorphism**  | Interface references call overridden methods at runtime      |
